Chef got another sequence as a birthday present. He does not like this sequence very much because
it is not sorted. Since you are a good programmer, Chef is asking for your help.

You are given a sequence A1,A2,…,AN and an integer K. You may perform any number of 
operations of the following type (in any order): choose a valid integer i and swap A[i] 
with A[i+K]. Can you sort the sequence this way?
Example Input
2
4 1
1 4 2 3
4 2
1 4 2 3
Example Output
yes
no
Explanation
Example case 1: We may freely swap adjacent elements, so the sequence can be sorted e.g. 
in the following way: (1,4,2,3)→(1,2,4,3)→(1,2,3,4).


#include<iostream>
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(void){
       int t;
       cin>>t;
       while(t-->0){
        long int n,k;
        cin>>n>>k;
        long int arr[n];
        for(long int i=0;i<n;i++){
            cin>>arr[i];
        }
        for(long int i=0;i<n;i++){
            for(long int j=i;j<n;j+=k){
                if(arr[i]>arr[j]){
                    swap(arr[i],arr[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        if(is_sorted(arr,arr+n)){
            cout<<"yes"<<endl;
        }
        else{
            cout<<"no"<<endl;
        }
       }
}
